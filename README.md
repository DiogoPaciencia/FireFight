# FireFight
Using Java, me and a friend created a grid-based 2D videogame where you play
as a firefighter racing against the clock trying to put out fires in the woods, with
each level getting increasingly more difficult, and complete with a user
leaderboard for high scores. We used OOP concepts in order to make this project
as simple and scalable as possible.
